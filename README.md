**Weather Dashboard**

User Story:

As a traveler, I need an app or a quick reference to generate an easy to read weather forecast at any given  time to plan my trips around.  
I go back and and forth a lot, for business or pleasure, it would help to keep all my places stored in a history,or a populated list to refer back to when needed.
